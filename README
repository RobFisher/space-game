Space Game
==========

I want to make a space simulation game with exploration, trading and possibly
combat, rather like Elite. But I can't do graphics and I am somewhat inspired
by the early days of hacking text games like Adventure. So that's what this
is.

Feature ideas
-------------

* Procedurally generated galaxy.
* Trading simulation.
* Some kind of online multi-player.
* Combat?
* Smartphone UI?
